# Django-Online-Store
Demo version one of freelance projects.  My client sells digit and none-digit products. 

Digit products are shipped by email, while none-digit products by selected physical address. Shopping is available for both none-registered and registered users. Registration only simplifies buying procces due to all necessary data fields automatic filling. Payment is done through PayPal services.

## Note!
Cookie creation is done for __none-authenticated__ users to store purchuased items with billing and shipping information.
